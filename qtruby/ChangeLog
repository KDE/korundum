2005-09-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added richtext/calendar, orderform and syntaxhighlighter examples
	* Fix bug in '>', '<=', '<' and '<=' operator methods where they were
	  clashing with methods in Kernel
	* The struct Qt::TextLayout::FormatRange is now in QtRuby

2005-09-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added painting/basicdrawing,  concentriccircles,  painterpaths  and
	  transformations examples

2005-09-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added mainwindows/application, menus, recentfiles and sdi examples

2005-09-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added layouts/basiclayouts, borderlayout and flowlayouts examples
	* Either a Qt::Layout, Qt::WidgetItem or Qt::SpacerItem ruby instance
	  is created to wrap a C++ QLayoutItem instance, using
	  QLayoutItem::widget() and QLayoutItem::spacerItem() methods to
	  determine the exact class.

2005-09-18  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Initial checkin of the Qt4 version of the rbuic tool
	* Added designer/calculatorform example

2005-09-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed problem with Qt::SqlTableModel.select() reported by
	  Daniel Morris as a Qt3 QtRuby bug

2005-09-01  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added draganddrop/draggabletext, draggableicons, fridgemagnets, 
	  puzzle examples.
	* Added itemviews/dirview, chart and pixelator Qt4 examples.
	* Fixed bug in QtByteArray marshalling where an underlying QByteArray
	  was not being created if the Qt::ByteArray was created by passing a
          ruby String to the constructor.
	* Qt::ModelIndex's are not deleted on garbage collection as it caused a
	  crash
	* Added qVariantValue() and qVariantFromValue() methods

2005-08-25 Caleb Tennsi <caleb@aei-tech.com>
	* Changed metaobject creation to not use d pointers per the comment in the
	  code.

2005-08-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added dialogs examples; complexwizard, extension,  findfiles,  
	  simplewizard,  standarddialogs and  tabdialog
	* Changed the types of Qt3 long longs and other Q_* types to the 
	  Qt4 equivalents

2005-08-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added windowflags example
	* Some enum names for Qt::WindowFlags were clashing with QtRuby
	  class names, such as Qt::Dialog. So some constants were added to
	  use instead, renamed with an ending of 'Type'.

2005-08-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed some code to obtain a Qt::Object's properties for Qt4. Added 
	  property inspecting code for the new QPointF, QRectF etc types
	* Fixed a missing attr accessor bug in Qt::Enum
	* Added the sliders, spinboxes and tetrix code examples

2005-08-22  Caleb Tennis <caleb@aei-tech.com>
        * Started a migration to more template based classes.  Hopefully this is
          just a start, but this *should* reduce redundant code by making use of
          C++ templates for marshalling the various types.

2005-08-22  Caleb Tennis <caleb@aei-tech.com>

        * Readded findChildren and findChild methods in C code under Qt::Object

2005-08-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* It isn't an error to pass a NULL void** stack to a qt_metacall() invocation.
	  So don't throw a ruby exception, and assume it's for a slot with no args and
	  no return type.
	* Added the icons, imageviewer, lineedits, screenshot and scribble example
	  programs
	* Qt::Enum is no longer a subclass of Qt::Integer, and it handles its own
	  arithmetic ops. A logical or arithmetic op on a Qt::Enum always returns a
	  ruby Integer, rather than a Qt::Enum as before.


2005-08-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added calculator, charactermap, groupbox and wiggly to code examples
	* Fixed crash in ruby QString signal types
	* Improved runtime resolution of the Qt4 Qt::Event classes
	* Added a Qt::Char.to_s method for converting a Qt::Char to a ruby
	  string

2005-08-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added digitalclock example

2005-08-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added various marshallers for QVector list types
	* Added the analogclock example from Qt4
	* Added inspect methods for the new Qt::PointF, Qt::RectF etc
	  types

2005-08-19  Caleb Tennis <caleb@aei-tech.com>
        * For marshalling ItemLists, prefer using ->at(index) over an iterator

	* Add findChild and findChildren methods which attempt to mimic their Qt::Object
          counterparts.  Unit tests included.  e.g.:   
            object.findChildren(Qt::Widget) 
            object.findChildren(Qt::Object, "ObjectName")
            object.findChildren(Qt::Object, /SomeName*/)

            findChild just returns the closest child to the parent from findChildren

2005-08-19  Caleb Tennis <caleb@aei-tech.com>

        * Added a unittests.rb file as the start of a unit test suite for
          verifying QtRuby things are working properly and we don't create
          regressions.

        * Qt4ify some of the code in handlers.cpp

        * Modified new_qobject to only add method definitions if the kclass
          doesn't respond_to qt_metacall (was a TODO item).
 
        * Prefer using Ruby's ALLOCA_N over calloc in new_qt

2005-08-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added various marshallers for converting Qt4 C++ lists to and from
	  ruby Arrays

2005-08-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added marshaller to convert QMap<int,QVariant> to ruby Hash

2005-08-18  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a QMetaObject was constructed on the fly, the metaObject
	  for the superClass was being obtained via Qbject::staticMetaClass()
	  which returns a copy. However, this messed up qobject_cast() and
	  QMetaObject::cast(), so now the parent metaObject is obtained via
	  QObject::metaObject() which returns a pointer to a QMetaObject.

2005-08-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added Qt::MetaObject.slotNames() and signalNames() from Qt3 as they
	  are very useful when using the KDevelop debugger
	* If Qt::Object.metacall() can't be found in the Smoke library a ruby exception
	  is thrown

2005-08-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Left some debugging code in. qt_metacall() was not being called 
	  correctly for non-ruby C++ slots.

2005-08-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* QtRuby now ported to Qt4. Pure Qt4 code with no dependencies on
	  libQt3Support
	* Qt4 style QMetaObjects are created on the fly. Slots and signals work
	  using QObject::qt_metacall() and QMetaObject::activate()
	* The Cannon games tutorials t1 to t14 have been ported to Qt4 QtRuby.
	* More work needed on the garbage collection mark() function. For instance,
	  it isn't possible to iterate through the items in a QListView in the same way as
	  before.

2005-08-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	
	* Caleb Tennis wrote:
	  One nice feature would be to allow Qt::Object::inherits() to use the QtRuby 
	  naming scheme for valid lookups.  For example, right now:

	    irb(main):001:0> w = Qt::Widget.new(nil)
	    irb(main):002:0> w.inherits("Qt::Widget")
	    => true
	    irb(main):003:0> w.inherits("Qt::Object")
	    => false
	    irb(main):004:0> w.inherits("QWidget")
	    => true
	    irb(main):005:0> w.inherits("QObject")
	    => true

	* Inherits now works for "QObject", and for "Qt::Object" as well.

2005-08-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

        * Added a file called 'COPYING' to the qtruby project, with a note that
          the 'Qt' trademark in the QtRuby name is used with Trolltech's permission,
          followed by the text of the GPL v2 license.

2005-07-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Qt4 port, initial checkin
	* Very little works yet, just hello world

2005-07-15  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Qt::Socket started working correctly when I and regenerated and rebuilt 
	  my Smoke library. Before then it was calling the wrong version of 
	  QSocket::at() for some reason, and wasn't discarding bytes that had 
	  already been read.
	* Removed comment from the client.rb example about Qt::Socket.canReadLine
	  always returning true now it works.

2005-07-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added example programs for client/server programming with Qt::Socket
	  and associated classes. client.rb illustrates current bugs in QtRuby
	* Qt::Socket.canReadLine() always returns true
	* Qt::readLine() seg faults when called a second time
	* A memory leak and seg faulting problems like the above were reported
	  by Caleb Tennis

2005-07-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a Qt method returned a QString value type, such as:
	       QString QSocket::readLine()
	  A temporary QString was being created that wasn't deleted and caused a 
	  memory leak. Fixes problem reported by Caleb Tennis.

2005-06-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved display of Qt::Enums in the KDevelop debugger. With a p
	  command it just looks like a constant, but a pretty print pp command
	  shows the type of the underlying C++ enum:

	  (rdb:1) p AlignTop 
	  16

	  (rdb:1) pp AlignTop 
	  #<Qt::Enum:0x1825db68 @type=Qt::AlignmentFlags, @value=16>

2005-06-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
	
	* Upped the version to 1.0.10

2005-06-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The Object.id method was clashing with the one in Qt::WidgetStack.
	  Both methods now work correctly. Fixes problem reported by Dave M.

2005-05-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The rbuic '-subimpl' option now works correctly

2005-05-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The initialize methods in code generated by the rbuic tool, now have
	  named parameters with default values, rather than '*k'

2005-05-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug where the rbuic tool was generating incorrect code
	  for an array of strings used as a combo box value

2005-05-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added support for the QScintilla text editing widget, including an optional 
	   '--enable-qscintilla=yes' configure option. The QScintilla classes are included in a
	  Qext:: namespace. Thanks to Blackshack for the idea and configure code.
	* The KDE namespace modules are only created if the Korundum extension is used.
	  Otherwise the Object namespace was being polluted with unused constants.
	* Some enums in the QScintilla headers had a spurious comma after
	  the last enum value, and kalyptus was failing with a parse error.
	  The comma is now ignored.

2005-05-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* '!=' operator methods in the Smoke library were being shown via ruby introspection when they
	  can't actually be written in ruby, and are derived from the corresponding '==' operator method.
	* '==' operator methods can now be called.

2005-05-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

        * Fixed bug in Smoke code generation where spaces were not being removed from operator
          methods such as 'operator *'
        * Operator methods are now displayed correctly via ruby introspection

2005-05-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved the format of enums displayed by rbqtapi and rbkdeapi

2005-05-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed unused Qt::Internal functions
	* Added KNS:: to the namespaces expected by the rbkdeapi tool
	* Introspection via Object#methods, public_methods, protected_methods and singleton_methods
	  or Module#constants, instance_methods, protected_instance_methods and public_instance_methods
	  now all include methods from the Smoke runtime. This fixes part of the request in bug 105772, but
	  not enabling 'respond_to?' to be used with Smoke methods.

2005-05-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The Kernel.format() method was clashing with the Qt::MimeSource.format() method.
	  The correct method is now called according to the type of the first argument. Fixes
	  problem reported by Armin Joellenbeck

2005-04-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed superfluous "require 'pp'" statement

2005-04-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	*  Upped the version to 1.0.9 for the RubyForge release

2005-04-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed regressions in the rbqtapi and rbkdeapi utilities caused by the Qt::Internal namespace
	  tidy up
	* Qt::version and Qt::ruby_version had wrongly been moved to the Qt::Internal module

2005-04-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Upped the version to 1.0.8 for the RubyForge release

2005-03-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* An 'include Qt' statement in qtruby.rb where a couple of methods were being added to
	  class Module was causing all the Qt methods to be added to Module. Oops, this a really
	  serious bug. Various methods in qtruby.rb are now module methods in the Qt::Internal
	  module. Big thanks to Eric Veensta and Samir Patel for pointing out this can of worms.

	* It also fixes a problem reported by David Crosby where a "require 'time'" statement was
	  incompatible with a "require 'Qt'" statement. As the cause was unknown, a hacky workround
	  had to be added, which is no longer needed.

2005-03-24  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a subclass of QObject is instantiated in the C++ world, and the exact class doesn't
	  exist in ruby, then scan up the inheritance heirarchy via QObject::metaObject() until a
	  class is found which does have a ruby equivalent. Fixes problem reported by Dmitry Morozhnikor
	  where a KViewPart was being returned as a Qt::Object, rather than a KParts::ReadOnlyPart.
	* The internal method 'cast_object_to()' now takes a class literal as a second parameter,
	  rather than the class name as a string

2005-03-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Moved Qt.rb from qtruby/lib/Qt to qtruby/lib. Fixes problem building qtruby on Mac OS X
	  with extconf.rb reported by Michael Doppler
	* Rename 'README.build' as INSTALL

2005-02-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Upped the version to 1.0.7 for the KDE 3.4 release
	* Removed the khtml:: namespace as it wasn't being used

2005-02-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a KNS:: namespace for the KNewStuff library

2005-02-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The KDE::Win::WindowInfo nested class is included in the Korundum runtime

2005-01-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Made some changes to get code generated by the rbkconfig_compiler
	  to work. When an argument is a non-const reference to a primitive 
	  type, or a QString or QStringList, then don't delete it after the
	  method call. This is because a class like KConfigSkeleton takes
	  references, and then 'squirrels them away' - before the references
	  were just pointing to junk on the stack.
	* The method 'isImmutable' is added to KDE::ConfigSkeletonItems

2005-01-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* If a ruby Array is passed as an argument to an overloaded method, give
	  priority to QStringList args.

2005-01-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* rbuic was giving widgets names containing a '@' to match the ruby instance variable
	  name. However, this doesn't work with KDE::ConfigDialog which expects the names to
	  match the ones generated in a KDE::ConfigSkeleton by rbkconfig_compiler so '@' is no
	  longer added.

2005-01-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug reported by Ian Monroe where the KIO.copy() method wasn't being found in
	  the Smoke runtime. Modules methods are now trapped with method_missing and
	  despatched to call Smoke methods correctly
	* Added support for the KDE::ConfigSkeleton and subclasses. Constructors for nested
	  classes can now be called correctly

	CCMAIL: ian.monroe@gmail.com

2005-01-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a Qt::Integer.coerce method so that Qt::Integers and Qt::Enums can be
	  combined in arithmetic expressions with ruby Integers. 

2005-01-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Upped the version to 1.0.6 for the KDE 3.4 beta 1 release

2005-01-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The Qt::Object pretty_print method now shows the class name of enum properties

2004-12-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed an interesting bug reported by Stephan Oehlert. Kernel has a method called 
	  open() which takes a String as the first argument. But when a call is made to an open() 
	  method in the Qt classes, it messes up the method_missing() logic to divert it to the 
	  Smoke library. Instead it attempts to call the Kernel method with the wrong arg types.

	* The problem is fixed by calling the appropriate method based on the 
	  type of the first arg. However, it is no longer possible to override virtual methods
	  called 'open'.

	CCMAIL: stephan.oehlert@gmx.net

2004-12-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a parent attribute to the Qt::Object pretty_print() method
	* Removed all the properties from the Qt::Object inspect() method except name,
	  x, y, width, height (the last four for for Qt::Widgets only). This speeds up fetching
	  the details of Qt::Objects that have more than just a handful of children.
	  The full details can still be fetched with a pretty_print() call via a debugger 'pp'
	  command.

2004-12-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The qtruby runtime needs to be able to run the code for an initialize() method up
	  to the point where the C++ instance has been constructed and wrapped, and then
	  jump out. It then re-runs initialize() with the wrapped instance. Before a callcc() call
	  had been used for the jumping which worked fine. However, it made the frame stack
	  look strange when debugging code with the KDevelop debugger. The fix is to use 
	  catch and throw instead, as they leave the stack in a more normal looking state.

2004-12-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a work round for a bug caused by an incompatibility between QtRuby
	  the 'require time' statement, reported by David Crosby
	
	CCMAIL: dcrosby42@gmail.com

2004-12-18  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a 'receivers' property to the Qt::Object inspector. This allows the active signal
	  connections for a Qt::Object instance to be viewed in the KDevelop debugger as a 
	  Hash. The hash keys are the signal names, and the hash values are arrays of the target 
	  signals/slots as Qt::Connection instances.

2004-12-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added 'metaObject' as an expandable property for Qt::Objects. This allows the
	  Qt::MetaClass class heirarchy to be browsed, and signals/slots declarations inspected.

2004-12-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug in lower case/underscore method naming to camel case conversion

2004-12-15  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added an attribute of 'children' to the Qt::Object inspect method, which is an array
   of the Qt::Object's children
 * The QObjects in a QObjectList were not being created with the exact ruby class
   if they hadn't been allocated from within the ruby code, and just left as Qt::Objects

2004-12-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Qt::Object properities of type enum are shown by name in the KDevelop debugger,
   and not as numeric literals

2004-12-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Changed the format of the Qt::Color inspect string to #<Qt::Color:0x0 #ffffff>
 * Added some more attributes to the Qt::Font inspector
 * Added a Qt::Cursor inspector

2004-12-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed a bug where the debugger was calling an inspect method on an instance
   which wasn't fully initialized yet, and not of type T_DATA.

2004-12-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added inspect() and pretty_print() methods for Qt::SizePolicy
 * Greatly improved the Qt::Object Qt property based inspect() and pretty_print()
   methods. Property types such as Qt::Point, Qt::Font and Qt::Rect can be 
   viewed as expandable items in the KDevelop debugger variable tree.

2004-12-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * More inspect() and pretty_print() methods for common classes to improve debugging -
   Qt::Color, Qt::Font, Qt::Point, Qt::Rect, Qt::Size, Qt::Date, Qt::DateTime and Qt::Time
   
2004-12-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added inspect() and pretty_print() methods for Qt::Objects that get the QObject properties and
   show them as 'name=value' pairs. This means the KDevelop debugger can make Qt::Object 
   variables expandable and show their properties.

2004-11-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Upped the QtRuby version to 1.0.5 for the KDE 3.3.2 release

2004-10-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * qError(), qWarning() and qFatal() are now Object instance methods, rather than Qt module
   methods. This means they don't need to be referenced with an ugly 'Qt.' module scope anymore.

2004-10-21  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * If a class method was called before super, it was wrongly throwing an exception
   as an error. For instance, this call to i18n():

               def initialize()
                   super(TreeList, i18n("My App Preferences"),
                            Help|Default|Ok|Apply|Cancel, Ok)
      ...


2004-10-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Until super has been called in an initialize() method, Qt methods can't be called on
   it. An exception is now thrown 'Instance not initialized', instead of it causing a seg fault.
 * For instance:

     class MyWidget < Qt::ComboBox
         def initialize
             # Must call super first
             insertItem('abc')
             super
         end
     end

 * Fixes problem reported by Han Holl
 CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-16  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Upped the version to 1.0.4 for the RubyForge release
 * Added some names to AUTHORS from the ChangeLog

2004-10-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * If the smokeruby_mark() function was called for an instance of a QObject, it should
   mark all the instances below it in the QObject tree, as not needing garbage collection. 
   However, if a node in the tree didn't have a mapping onto a ruby instance the marking 
   process stopped there, even though the grandchildren and their descendants might 
   have a valid mapping onto ruby instances.
 * The solution is to always traverse the entire tree. Fixes problem reported by Han Holl.

 * All the Qt::CanvasItems owned by a Qt::Canvas are marked with rb_gc_mark() to
   prevent them being garbage collected
 * The top level widgets are no longer disposed() on Qt::Application exit
 * Fixed some bugs in the chart example. 

2004-10-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed arg matching to give priority to 'int' or 'signed' when passed a ruby Integer, or
   'double' when passed a ruby Float
 * The chart example can now save and load chart files

2004-10-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added greater than and less than operators to Qt::Enum, so that enums can be compared with
   Integers
 * Added the chart example for Qt Tutorial #2

2004-10-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Qt::Application.ARGV. It returns the original ruby ARGV array with Qt command line 
   options removed.

2004-10-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a global flag 'application_terminated'. Once this is set the QtRuby runtime will no longer
   delete any C++ instances. This will hopefully fix crash on application exit problems reported 
   by Thibauld Favre.

 CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The recent fix for checking invalid arg types, didn't work with nil passed as a value

2004-10-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * A QRgb[] color table was being wrongly deleted after marshalling

2004-10-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * If a ruby method overriding a virtual method returned a primitive type when an instance of a class
   was expected, it caused a seg fault. A ruby exception is now thrown instead. Fixes problem reported by
   Han Holl.

 * For instance,
                    class ContainerGrid < Qt::Widget
                        def sizeHint
                            # next line should return a Qt::Size, not an integer
                            100
                        end
                     end
 
   Now gives the following error:

               qsize.rb:12:in `method_missing': Invalid type, expecting QSize (ArgumentError)
                   from qsize.rb:12

 CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The smokeruby_mark() function was only marking the immediate children of a
   Qt::Object for not being garbage collected. It now marks all the Qt::Objects
   in the object tree below it.

2004-10-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Qt Designer Tutorial 'Creating Dialogs' translated into QtRuby. It
   shows how you can combine ruby code generated from .ui files with the rbuic
   tool, with your own code.

 * The .ui files and images are identical to the original C++ versions.

 * It features a simple Makefile to run rbuic when you change the .ui files, and
   regenerate the ruby sources.

2004-10-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed rbuic '-embed' option which had been broken after adding DCOP suppot
   to Korundum, after changes in the Qt::ByteArray class.
 * Fixed QRgb* marshalling problem where the ruby value was overflowing a signed int.
   The target for marshalling is now an array of unsigned ints.
 * When a Qt::Application exits after returning for an Qt::Application.exec() call, the top
   level widgets are deleted as well as the Qt::Application itself. This fixes a problem where
   ruby does garbage collection in an arbitrary order after the ruby app has exited. It destroys
   a ruby Hash of QMetaData info that the Qt::Application or Qt::MainWindow need to clean up.
 * The layout of the ruby code generated by rbuic has been improved with better indenting.
 * attr_reader attribute accessors have been added for the most important instance variables 
   in an rbuic generated class to make them more easily accessed from another class.

2004-10-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Given a C++ instance and an approximate classname, the QtRuby runtime uses the
   various Qt rtti mechanisms such as QObject::className() to improve the resolution
   of the name. However, the numeric classId into the array of classnames in the Smoke
   runtime was not being updated in line with the more accurate name. 
 * This caused problems with method argument matching which uses the numeric classId
   rather than the ruby object's classname, and so QtRuby wrongly assumed that a an
   instance of a Qt::Widget was a Qt::Object.
 * Fixes problem reported by Han Holl

 CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Fixed a couple of errors in the rbuic generated code found as a result of
   the recently improved stricter arg type matching.

2004-10-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * When a ruby app exits, rb_gc_call_finalizer_at_exit() is called and all the ruby
   instances are garbage collected. The problem is that this is done in an arbitrary
   order, and Qt::Application was occasionally crashing in its destructor because 
   QMetaObject info it still needed was being deleted before then.

 * Fixes problem reported by Thibauld Favre

 CCMAIL: <tfavre@mandrakesoft.com>

2004-10-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * When a QMetaData object was contructed the class name was a pointer from a ruby
   string, and was being corrupted when the string was freed. The string is now copied.

2004-10-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Han Holl's report about a when you pass an incorrect arg type to a QtRuby
   method, it caused a crash has opened a 'can of worms'. This was because there
   was no arg type checking if there was only one candidate method in the
   Smoke runtime. Now that arg type checking is applied to all QtRuby method calls, not
   not just those that after lookup in Smoke map onto a single method, the overloaded
   method resolution via the arg types has had to be greatly improved. This has
   been done, and so the arg type matching is now extremely fussy.

 CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * An optimization in the overloaded method resolution matching causes a crash;
   instead of throwing a ruby exception when a programming error is made.
   If there is only one method found in the Smoke runtime, it assumes that it must 
   be the right one and just takes that.

 * For example:

     lay = Qt::HBoxLayout.new(self)
     ed = Qt::LineEdit.new('blah',self)
     # The next line should be: lay.addWidget(ed)
     lay.addLayout(ed)

  * Fixes problem reported by Han Holl

  CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-10-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * A common programming error is to accidently leave off the 'new' method call when
   creating an instance. The QtRuby runtime wasn't correctly trapping an attempt to
   call an instance method on a class object, and was seg faulting rather than
   throwing an exception.

 * For example:

                    # The next line should be:  lay = Qt::HBoxLayout.new(self)
                   lay = Qt::HBoxLayout
                   ed = Qt::LineEdit.new('blah',self)
                   lay.addWidget(ed)

 * Fixes problem reported by Han Holl

 * Upped version to 1.0.3 for the KDE 3.3.1 release

2004-10-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Ruby Array to QPair<int,int>& marshaller

2004-09-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The resolve_classname() function in handlers.cpp uses the various Qt rtti mechanisms to
   get a more accurate classname to instantiate as a ruby instance. It has now been extended
   with a callback to the Korundum library to do the same for KDE classes.

 CCMAIL: zack@kde.org

2004-09-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Jim Menard's ruboids as an OpenGL/Qt::GL* Widgets example
 * Improved instructions and exconf.rb for building the gui extension from Michal 'hramrach' Suchanek

2004-09-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Upped the version to 1.0.2 for Rubyforge release

2004-09-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a 'qui' extension for reading in .ui Qt Designer files at runtime
 * For example:

     require 'Qt'
     require 'qui'

     a = Qt::Application.new(ARGV)
     if ARGV.length == 0
         exit
     end

     if ARGV.length == 2
         QUI::WidgetFactory.loadImages( ARGV[ 0 ] )
             w = QUI::WidgetFactory.create( ARGV[ 1 ] )
             if w.nil?
             exit
         end
             w.show()
            a.connect( a, SIGNAL('lastWindowClosed()'), a, SLOT('quit()') )
            a.exec()
     end


2004-09-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Upped the version to 1.0.1 for the current Rubyforge release

2004-09-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Kate:: and KTextEdit:: namespaces for writing Kate plugins

2004-09-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Some newer changes from the uic were added to the rbuic tool.

2004-09-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Brought the rbuic code to uncompress zip files in line with the current uic code
 * Added a qmake project file for building the rbuic tool on Mac OS X, and some
   notes on how to build QtRuby on a Mac.

2004-08-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added Kontact module to provide a namespace for the kontact plugin api

2004-08-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Underscore naming for can be used for method names instead of camel case if
   preferred. Any underscores in method names are removed, and the following
   character is capitalised. For example, either of these two forms can be used
   to call the same method:
  
     create_standard_status_bar_action()
  
     createStandardStatusBarAction()

2004-08-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * A 'thing?' ruby method can now be used as a synonym for either isThing() or hasThing() in the Smoke runtime

2004-08-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Upped the QtRuby version to 1.0.0 - it must work now then..

2004-08-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added 'long long' and 'unsigned long long' marshallers

2004-07-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The smokeruby_mark() gc marking f'n now marks the QTableItems owned
   by a QTable so they don't get garbage collected, even if there are no
   remaining references in the user code.

2004-07-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Added a template based method for QValueList marshallers, and several
   QValueList types.

2004-07-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Removed any marshaller types that weren't in the Smoke runtime from the
   type name to marshaller function lookup table.

2004-07-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * If a class doesn't have a virtual destructor, then no mapping was being
   kept from the C++ instance to the corresponding ruby value. If the class
   had virtual method callbacks, this meant that the ruby instance couldn't
   be found, and the callback couldn't be made.
 
 * Hence, the Qt::ToolTip callback in examples/qt-examples/tooltip didn't
   work, as that class doesn't have a virtual destructor.

 * Added an 'isEnum()' function to use when matching args in overloaded
   method resolution.

 * QCString arg types are chosen in preference to QByteArray ones, matching
   against ruby strings, when resolving an overloaded method call.

 * Qt::Enums and Qt::Integers can be marshalled to uints, longs and ulongs as
   well as ints.
   
 * Added a '==' operator to Qt::Enums so they can be compared with ruby Integers

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Qt::Integer arithmetic and bit operations return Qt::Integers, rather
   than ruby Integers so that ops can be nested as for Qt::Enums.

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The recently added Qt::Integer bit operators were returning a ruby Integer
   type. When they were nested, the Integer didn't know how to convert the
   Enum it was being or'd with to an Integer.
 
 * The solution is to add bit operators to the Enum class which return Enums
   rather than Integers.

 * The following code didn't work:
     
     def initialize(message)
         super(nil, "passivedlg",
                 Qt::WStyle_Customize | Qt::WX11BypassWM | Qt::WStyle_StaysOnTop |
                 Qt::WStyle_Tool | Qt::WStyle_NoBorder)

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * Replaced QString casts to 'const char *' with latin1() calls

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

 * The Qt::Enum class was missing bit operations, so various bit methods
   were added to Qt::Enum's superclass, Qt::Integer.
 
 * This was causing this line from examples/uimodules/uidialogs.rb to fail:

     dlg =   KDE::DialogBase.new(parent, "sample_dialog", false, caption,
                                        KDE::DialogBase::Ok | KDE::DialogBase::Cancel, 
                                 KDE::DialogBase::Ok, true )

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added error messages for invalid slot or signal declarations

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The standard ruby error message for missing constants and methods is
	  now used when they can't be found in the Smoke library. Removed Alex's
	  comment about the previous approach, now I agree this is the best way 
	  to show errors.

	CCMAIL: me@lypanov.ne

2004-07-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added qDebug(), qFatal() and qWarning() module methods

2004-07-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The parsing of types passed to slots, (or returned from dcop slots) didn't
	  work with template types containing commas such as 'QMap<QString,QString>'.
	* Added 'QMap<QString,QString>&' and 'QMap<QString,QVariant>&' to the
	  handlers.cpp string to marshaller lookup table.

2004-07-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added marshallers for QMap<QString,QString> and QMap<QString,QVariant> to and from ruby hashes

2004-07-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The error messages for missing methods or missing constants now give the
	  name of the missing item.
	* For example, this incorrect line:

	    color_group.setColor( ColorGroup::MyMissingConst, blue )
	  
	  Gives this error:

	    splitter.rb:16:in `const_missing': unresolved constant 
	        reference MyMissingConst (ArgumentError)

	* Implements suggestion from Jeff on the kdebindings list

	CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-07-19  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added Qt::Enum type. Before a C++ enum was being marshalled to a ruby
	  Integer, and the type name of the enum was lost. A Qt::Enum is a subclass
	  of Integer with an extra type name.
	* This fixes a problem with overloaded method resolution where two methods differ
	  only be an enum type such as this:

	    # KPasswordEdit(EchoMode echoMode, QWidget *parent, const char *name);
	    # KPasswordEdit(EchoModes echoMode, QWidget *parent, const char *name);

	    pw2 = KDE::PasswordEdit.new(KDE::PasswordEdit::ThreeStars, page, "")

2004-07-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* After a non-const string arg was passed to a method, the value of the QString
	  is copied into the ruby value. But it wasn't being correctly converted to the
	  correct string format according to $KCODE.
	* QString to ruby string conversions in QStringLists were not localised either.

2004-07-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed superfluous '(void *)' cast which was causing compilation
	  problems with gcc 3.4
	* Fixes problem reported by Jochen Immend�fer on comp.lang.ruby
	  CCMAIL: kde-bindings@kde.org

2004-07-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Qt eucJP and Shift-JIS codecs used to support ruby $KCODE values of 's' 
	  for SJIS and 'e' for EUC

2004-07-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added support for strings in QtRuby programs being written in UTF-8.
	  Use the '-Ku' command line option or '$KCODE=u' in the program.
	* Removed recently added QChar marshalling as it wasn't very i18n friendly

2004-07-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added QChar marshalling

2004-07-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fix for passing C++ 'bool*' and 'bool&' argument types
	  There is a similar problem for bool arg types as with ints, and the mutable
	  Qt::Boolean class can be used like this:
		
	    # QFont getFont(bool * ok, const QFont&initial, QWidget* parent = 0);		
		
	    ok = Qt::Boolean.new
	    font = Qt::FontDialog.getFont(ok, Qt::Font.new("Helvetica [Cronyx]", 10), self)
	    if !ok.nil? 
                # font is set to the font the user selected
	    else 
                # the user canceled the dialog
	    end
		
	  Use 'nil?' to test the value returned in the Boolean
	* Signal and slot type signatures are 'normalized' and any unwanted white space
	  removed
	* Fixed problem with QByteArray arg type matching in overloaded method resolution

2004-07-04  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fix for passing C++ 'int*' and 'int&' argument types
	  Ruby passes numeric values by value, and so they can't be changed when passed to a
	  method. The Qt::Integer class provides a mutable numeric type which does get updated
	  when passed as an argument. For example, this C++ method 'findByFileContent()':
		
		# static Ptr findByFileContent( const QString &fileName, int *accuracy=0 );

		acc = Qt::Integer.new(0)
        	fc = KDE::MimeType.findByFileContent("mimetype.rb", acc)
		
	  It supports the arithmetic operators, and so expressions such as 'acc + 3' 
	  will work.

2004-07-02  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Replaced obsolete STR2CSTR() calls with StringValuePtr()

2004-06-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The internal findAllMethods() method now returns nil rather than an empty array
	  if the given classid is greater than 'smoke->numClasses'. Otherwise, it wasn't 
	  possible to distinguish between a class with no methods, or reaching the end of
	  the classes array.

2004-06-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added QStrList marshalling

2004-06-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved Garbage Collection, dispose() and isDisposed() methods
	  - When a ruby instance is garbage collected, the underlying C++ instance will only be
	    deleted if it isn't 'owned' by a parent object. Normally this will 'just work', but
	    there are occasions when you need to delete the C++ ahead of garbage collection, and
	    whether or not it has a parent. Use the dispose() and isDisposed() methods like
	    this:
		
		item0.takeItem(item1)  
		item0.insertItem(item1)  
		
		item2.dispose
		if item2.isDisposed
		    puts "item2 is disposed"
		end

	  - Fixes problem reported by Hans Fugel
	
2004-06-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The marshalling TypeHandler function pointers are now looked up in a
	  QAsciiDict, rather than a ruby Hash.
	* Some unused functions removed
	* QtRuby version upped to 0.9.8

2004-06-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* New flags were added for Smoke methods - mf_internal and mf_copyctor.
	  This allows copy constructors which are only used internally by the ruby
	  runtime, to be excluded from the standard api.


2004-05-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When ARGV was passed to the Qt::Application constructor, it was being
	  altered, and the name of the ruby program added as a first entry. The
	  constructor now uses a copy of the array, and ARGV is left unchanged.

2004-05-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added a '-kde' option to the rbuic tool to generate require 'Korundum'
	  instead of require 'Qt' statements, and use KDE widgets.

2004-04-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Applied patch from Marek Janukowicz.
	* The patch fixes some perlisms, that caused errors on loading a Ruby file
	  generated from .ui file for Qt::MainWindow subclass

2004-04-20  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The rbuic now correctly names KDE widgets with a KDE:: prefix
	* If the rbuic -x option is used, a KDE top level is generated if any
	  KDE widgets have been found.

2004-04-17  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug in rbuic generated code for setResizeMode()

2004-04-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved classname resolution for QListViewItem and QTableItem subclasses using rtti() calls

2004-03-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Ruby slots and signals are now inherited correctly
	* This causes problems with code generated by the rbuic utility
	* Fixes bug 78273 reported by Imobach Sosa

2004-03-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When a mutable, non-const QString, int*, int&, bool* or bool& is passed
	  to a method, the corresponding ruby value is now updated after the 
	  method call.
	* Some f'ns are no longer static, so that the korundum extension can link
	  against them.

2004-03-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The f'n new_qobject is no longer static, and can be called from korundum

2004-03-01  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bugs in QCString, QString and QByteArray marshalling.
	  - When a C++ method with a mutable, non-const QCString arg type 
	    is called from ruby, the C++ arg value is copied back into the
	    corresponding ruby arg VALUE after the call.
	  - A pointer to a locally allocated QString was being returned,
	    giving memory corruption problems.
	* The default debug level in qtruby.rb is DebugLevel::OFF, otherwise
	  very verbose error messages are produced.

2004-01-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug where a QCString was being ranked equally with a QString,
	  when resolving ambiguous method overloading. Caused the KDE::URL
	  constructor to fail with a string arg.

2003-11-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added DOM:: namespace for the DOM:: classes in the Smoke library.
	* The scope operator in nested classnames is now '::' rather
	  than '__', so changed the qtruby runtime to expect that.

2003-11-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added the KillerFilter event filtering example from chapter 16
	  of 'Programming with Qt'
	* Improved classname resolution via the Qt rtti mechanisms in
	  QObject, QEvent and QCanvasItem. This fixed a problem in the
	  KillerFilter example when a QMouseEvent was passed to the ruby 
	  event handler, it was being instantiated as a ruby Qt::Event, 
	  rather than a Qt::MouseEvent.

2003-11-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved nil argument matching, and nil can match any type now
	  not just classes. Translated the code from the Qt.pm in PerlQt,
	  after discussion on the kde-perl list.
	* Fixed bug in rbuic where a C++ 'QString::null' was "" in ruby, and
	  should have been a nil.

2003-11-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Finally fixed huge leak, causing the progress.rb example to grow by
	  1 Mb a minute.
	* Added a cache from ruby classname to Smoke class id
	* Speeded up method selector look ups
	* Put some C++ code inside blocks to ensure that the destructor clean
	  up code was called, when the current f'n longjmp's up the stack rather
	  than returns normally.
	* QtRuby looking good, raised the version to 0.9.6 to celebrate

2003-11-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed some memory leaks
	* Ensured that any instance 'owned' by ruby, ie with the the allocated
	  flag set to true, is always added to the pointer_map.
	  Otherwise, the same C++ instance can be wrapped twice and will be deleted
	  twice.

2003-11-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* When marshalling a const ref type to a ruby VALUE, it is now copied
	* Applied some fixes for construct_copy() from the PerlQt version of
	  handlers.cpp
	* Fixed some minor bugs in the progress.rb Qt example

2003-11-03  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added method selector caching for class methods and constructors,
	  although performance still 'sedate' compared with C++ or Perl.

2003-10-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The smokeruby_mark() f'n now marks the QListViewItems in a QListView
	* Fixed a QLayoutItem crash in smokeruby_free()

2003-10-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The smokeruby_mark() f'n was completely wrong, as it is only called if 
	  the current object is already marked. So marking the current object
	  doesn't make a lot of sense. Instead, if the instance is a kind of
	  QObject then its childeren are marked.
	* The smokeruby_delete() object doesn't delete instances which have
	  parents of one sort or another.
	* Made some fixes to the tutorial examples
	* Removed equality '==' operator overloading as it only expects a single
	  arg in ruby, and not two.

2003-10-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Changed some error messages in do_method_missing() to be 'debug only' for now.

2003-10-22  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Got the checklists.rb example working after bug report from Mikhail Yakshin
	  - Corrected some coding errors in the example itself.
	  - The arg matching code in method_missing() has been improved and simplified.
	  - In the overloaded arg type resolution matching, an enum is type 'long'
	  - A class which matches exactly is a better match than a subclass.
	    Multiple matches are allowed as long as there is a 'best match'.
	  - Operator overloading now looks for methods of the form 'operator+=',
	    'operator-=' etc in the Smoke runtime.

2003-10-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed serious random crash problem
	  - qt_invoke() and qt_emit() were not calling super if a ruby signal or
	    slot hadn't been found, which stopped C++ signals from working. 
	  - This prevented destroy() signals from invoking event filter list clean
	    up when a QObject was deleted, leaving deleted instances in the list.
	  - 'QUObject*' args are now marshalled as a ruby list with a single
	    entry of a VALUE wrapping the pointer.
	* The ruby ALLOCA_N macro is no longer used as it is based on alloca(),
	  which doesn't seem a good idea. malloc(), calloc() and free() are used
	  instead

2003-10-11  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added khtml:: namespace, although it isn't in the SmokeKDE runtime yet
	* Improved method_missing error messages if a method can't be resolved

2003-10-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added KIO:: and KParts:: namespaces for the new classes in libsmokekde

2003-10-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Korundum KDE ruby extension 
	  - made various changes so it can be linked against the QtRuby code

2003-09-18  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed leading 'K' from class names of when adding to KDE:: namespace.
	  As per Germain Garand's suggestion on the kde-bindings list:

	  ..actually, I used the same scheme as for Qt when possible, that is:
	        $class =~ s/^Q/Qt::/ or
	        $class =~ s/^K/KDE::/ or
	        $class = "KDE::" . $class
	        unless $class eq "Qt";

2003-09-18  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added support for KDE classes under module KDE:: for use with
	  the new libsmokekde.so. You can now write KDE programs in Ruby,
	  here is Hello World:

	    about = KDE::KAboutData.new("one", "two", "three")
	    KDE::KCmdLineArgs.init(1, ["four"], about)
	    a = KDE::KApplication.new()
	    hello = KDE::KPushButton.new(nil) { setText "Hello World" }
	    a.setMainWidget(hello)
	    hello.show()
	    a.exec()

2003-09-14  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The rbuic -embed option finally works. Fixed QByteArray marshalling.

2003-09-13  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved the rbuic -embed option, and added some fixes

2003-09-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* More passing blocks to constructors fun! You can now also pass 
	  an arg to the block, and it will be run in the context of the arg:
		
		w = MyWidget.new { |theWidget| theWidget.setCaption "foobar" }

	I got this idea from the FXRuby bindings, from the ChangeLog:

	"This approach has the advantage that the initialization code now has
	access to the outer scope, as blocks normally would. Thanks to
	Rich Kilmer for this suggestion."

	If you don't pass an arg to the block, the block is run in the context 
	  of the new instance as before.

	* Debugging left in handlers.cpp (must stop doing this)

2003-09-12  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Marshallers now return Qnil, rather than Qundef (for internal use only)

2003-09-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved garbage collection with various 'ad hoc' rules from the
	  QtJava bindings about when it's ok/not ok to destruct an instance.
	  Not always just a 'parent() != 0' check in Qt.

2003-09-10  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added QByteArray <-> Ruby string marshaller

2003-09-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Blocks can now be passed to constructors, like this:
	    w = MyWidget.new { setCaption("foobar") }

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added method selector caching, scribbling may be slightly faster..

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* GC getting closer to working. Debugging code improved.

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* From below 'watch out for extra crashes!' - indeed! Have now disabled
	  smokeruby_free() and smokeruby_mark() until garbage collection works.

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The pointer_map is now a QPtrDict rather than a ruby Hash, and
	  the entries are weak references. An implementation was tried 
	  using the ruby WeakRef class, but it didn't work because rb_gc_mark()
	  didn't prevent them being garbage collected.
	* smokeruby_free() and smokeruby_mark() have been implemented
	* The C++ instance for a ruby object is deleted in smokeruby_free(),
	  so watch out for extra crashes!
	* Improved README with more details about QtRuby

2003-09-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved error message handling, changed rb_error() calls to rb_raise()
	* Decided changing method calls like foobar? to isFoobar() not a good idea,
	  as the Qt property could just as also be hasFoobar() or foobar() 

2003-09-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Set methods such as autoMask= are converted to setAutoMask()
	* Get methods such as modal? are converted to isModal()

2003-08-31  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* rbuic code generation brought up to date wrt Qt 3.2 uic

	  correctly. Only just tried this utility - Wow Alex!!

2003-08-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* findMethod() now looks in the QGlobalSpace pseudo class as well as the normal target class.
	* The bitBlt() code in the scribble example works correctly

2003-08-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed ugly _current_object global variable.

2003-08-12  Alexander Kellett   <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Add several new marshalling types - QCanvasItemList for example,
	  unfortuantely due to several improvements in Qt 3.2 these 
	  improvements will not be seen when compiling against Qt 3.1.2

2003-08-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>
