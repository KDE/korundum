	* Added QByteArray <-> Ruby string marshaller

2003-09-09  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Blocks can now be passed to constructors, like this:
	    w = MyWidget.new { setCaption("foobar") }

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added method selector caching, scribbling may be slightly faster..

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* GC getting closer to working. Debugging code improved.

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* From below 'watch out for extra crashes!' - indeed! Have now disabled
	  smokeruby_free() and smokeruby_mark() until garbage collection works.

2003-09-08  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* The pointer_map is now a QPtrDict rather than a ruby Hash, and
	  the entries are weak references. An implementation was tried 
	  using the ruby WeakRef class, but it didn't work because rb_gc_mark()
	  didn't prevent them being garbage collected.
	* smokeruby_free() and smokeruby_mark() have been implemented
	* The C++ instance for a ruby object is deleted in smokeruby_free(),
	  so watch out for extra crashes!
	* Improved README with more details about QtRuby

2003-09-07  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved error message handling, changed rb_error() calls to rb_raise()
	* Decided changing method calls like foobar? to isFoobar() not a good idea,
	  as the Qt property could just as also be hasFoobar() or foobar() 

2003-09-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Set methods such as autoMask= are converted to setAutoMask()
	* Get methods such as modal? are converted to isModal()

2003-08-31  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* rbuic code generation brought up to date wrt Qt 3.2 uic
	  Main change is that a 'languageChanged()' method is generated

	* rbuic() code generation fixes

2003-08-30  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added unary minus, and a test in opoverloading.rb

2003-08-29  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Updated TODO list, improved rbuic code generation for images

2003-08-28  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Improved operator overloading to work with operators not in QGlobalSpace

2003-08-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Changed the operator overloading implementation to be more like PerlQt

2003-08-27  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Translated the rbqtsh filePrint() method from perl

2003-08-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added 'changed' attribute to the MetaInfo class, so that the C++ metaObject
	  is reconstructed if the slots or signals are changed.
	* Changed window title on rbqtsh to 'QtRuby'. The example slot now works
	  correctly. Only just tried this utility - Wow Alex!!

2003-08-26  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* findMethod() now looks in the QGlobalSpace pseudo class as well as the normal target class.
	* The bitBlt() code in the scribble example works correctly

2003-08-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed ugly _current_object global variable. 
          The current target object is now passed to the MethodCall constructor.

2003-08-25  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Removed obsolete rb_enable_super() calls
	* Removed test for _current_object in class_method_missing()

2003-08-23  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added rbuic tool for ruby Qt Designer support

2003-08-12  Alexander Kellett   <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Add debug level setting via Qt::debug_level
	* When calling .new on a Qt object with a incorrect prototype
	  the list of appropriate constructors is printed
	* Fix a number of cases in which imperfect code would cause a crash

2003-08-11  Alex Zepeda   <zipzippy@sonic.net>

2003-08-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Added some TODO list entries, added Alex to the AUTHORS list

2003-08-06  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed 'int&' marshalling so script name appears in window title

2003-08-12  Alexander Kellett   <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Add several new marshalling types - QCanvasItemList for example,
	  unfortuantely due to several improvements in Qt 3.2 these 
	  improvements will not be seen when compiling against Qt 3.1.2

2003-08-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Moved SLOT(), SIGNAL() and emit() to global scope

2003-08-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

2003-08-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

	* Fixed bug in resolution of overloaded Qt::Popup.insertItem() methods

2003-08-05  Richard Dale  <Richard_Dale@tipitina.demon.co.uk>

2003-08-04  Alexander Kellett   <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Minor build fixes

	* Several more build fixes

2003-08-01  Alexander Kellett   <lypanov@kde.org>

	* Slightly improve ease of debugging of qtruby programs 
	  which subclass Qt base classes by print out some useful
	  debugging informationn when/if method_missing ever 
	  fails to find a matching function in the baseclass.

2003-08-01  Alex Zepeda   <zipzippy@sonic.net>
