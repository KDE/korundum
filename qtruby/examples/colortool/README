This is the Qt Designer Tutorial 'Creating Dialogs' translated into QtRuby. It
shows how you can combine ruby code generated from .ui files with the rbuic
tool, with your own code.

The .ui files and images are identical to the original C++ versions.

It features a simple Makefile to run rbuic when you change the .ui files, and
regenerate the ruby sources.
