Here is a Ruby SMOKE adaptor for Qt

Here is 'Hello World' in QtRuby:

#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

require 'Qt'

a = Qt::Application.new(ARGV)
hello = Qt::PushButton.new("Hello World!", nil)
hello.resize(100, 30)
a.setMainWidget(hello)
hello.show()
a.exec()

To call super in an overriden virtual method, you will need
to use ruby 1.8 or higher:

def paintEvent( e )
	print("hello there")
	super
end

There are no other known problems with older versions of ruby.

Have Fun!
