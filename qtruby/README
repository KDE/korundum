There you have it!

Here is 'Hello World' in QtRuby:

#!/usr/bin/ruby -w

require 'Qt'

a = Qt::Application.new(ARGV)
hello = Qt::PushButton.new("Hello World!", nil)
hello.resize(100, 30)
a.setMainWidget(hello)
hello.show()
a.exec()

To call super in an overriden virtual method, you will need
to use ruby 1.8 or higher:

def paintEvent( e )
	print("hello there")
	super
end

Also as only ruby 1.8 or higher provides const_missing 
syntax such as Qt::RichText will not be available to users
of older versions. To keep your programs running with
older versions of ruby simply use the old syntax (Qt.RichText)

There are no other known problems with older versions of ruby.

Have Fun!
