	* Added Ruby versions of the plasmoidviewer and engineexplorer tools. This
	  is a good test for the Plasma bindings and in particular the code in the
	  viewer is useful showing how to load an applet in a Qt::GraphicsView 
	  outside the Plasma process.
	* Fixed up some of the license text in the applet examples.

	* Some fixes for the digital clock example now KSharedConfig::Ptr
	  marshalling is working.
	* Added marshallers for QList<Plasma::Containment*>, QList<Plasma::PlotColor>,
	  QList<Plasma::SearchMatch*>, Plasma::Applet::List and 
	  Plasma::AbstractRunner::List

	* Add a '-DRUBY_EMBEDDED' option so that QtRuby is built with code to call
	  RUBY_INIT_STACK before a non-nested virtual method call or slot invocation

	* Added some type() methods for Plasma classes so that they are called, rather
	  than the Ruby Object#type method.
	* Added a marshaller for the Plasma::PackageStructure::Ptr type
