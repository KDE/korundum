* Separated the script engine plugins from the plasma ruby extension and moved
  the script engine code to kdebase with the other script engines

* Converted the webapplet to use the script engine api, and renamed it
  plasma_applet_ruby_webapplet

* Re-added the ruby version of the plasmoidviewer app

* Fix restoring of applet sizes.

* The marshaller for Plasma::DataEngine::Data was creating Qt::Variants with
  the wrong smoke pointer in the smokeruby_object struct, and this was causing
  a crash in the GC marking function.
* In PlasmaScripting::Applet, if a constant such as NoBackground is referenced
  and found to be missing, then look for it in Plasma::Applet.
* Fix bugs in the PlasmaScripting::Applet#showConfigurationInterface method
* Special case Plasma::Applet#id so it doesn't get a Ruby warning.
* In PlasmaScriptengineRuby::Applet the module name wasn't being derived 
  correctly from the Package path
* Add two versions of the clock applet
    * plasma_applet_ruby_clock uses the ScriptEngine api and is packaged as a
      plasmoid. It can be installed by typing the following command in the
      examples/applets directory:

      $ plasmapkg --install plasma_applet_ruby_clock --type plasmoid

    * analog-clock uses the C++ plugin api. Normally Ruby applets should be 
      written using the script engine api, and this example is only included
      to show how the two apis differ. The clocks are functionally identical.

* Add some fixes for the new Plasma::Frame and Plasma::Slider widgets

2008-07-03  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Add slots and signals for scripting applets and data engines corresponding
  to the ones in Plasma::Applet and Plasma::DataEngine
* Change the install destination to plasma_scriptengine_ruby and the modules
  of the plugin classes to match

* For script engine based applets, add the directory where the mainScript was
  found to the ruby load path.

2008-06-29  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* If a method call is invoked on a PlasmaScripting::Applet, then relay it to
  the underlying Plasma::Applet in the script engine.
* Add an event filter to the RubyAppletScript::Applet class so that scripting
  applets can implement event method handling overrides.
* Change various methods in the QGraphicsView and Plasma api so that they can
  accept instances of PlasmaScripting::Applet, and the instance is substituted
  for the underlying Plasma::Applet in the ScriptEngine.

2008-06-28  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>
* Make the Ruby ScriptEngine based plugins work
* Add a Ruby version of the Javascript Tiger applet
