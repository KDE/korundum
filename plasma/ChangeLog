	* Enclosed the applet and data engine example classes within Ruby
	  modules to match the new krubypluginfactory naming convention.
	  Everything installed under share/apps has underscores in the names
	  rather than hyphens. The .desktop file names contain hyphens, and
	  the X-KDE-PluginInfo-Name entries have hyphens too.

	* Update  the clock applets, plasmoidviewer and engineexplorer in line 
	  with their C++ equivalents

2008-04-17  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

	* Added a Plasma Data Engine for querying SPARQL endpoints, and returning
	  the results passed to setData() as two strings and a Qt::Variant - the 
	  source name, a variable name from the query, followed by a Qt::Variant 
	  containing a Soprano::Node as the value of the result. 
	* The example data engine queries DBPedia for details of the albums for an
	  artist given the artists name. 
	* So the source might be 'The Velvet Underground', and the results will be
	  all the albums they have released with album name, dbpedia resource urn
	  for the album, and date released. The album name appears both as the source
	  name and an attribute of the source too.
	* Enhanced the engineexplorer to work with Qt::Variants containing 
	  Soprano::Nodes

	* Added a Ruby version of the time data engine called 'ruby-time'
	* Renamed the analog and digital clock classes as they were both called
	  'Clock' and couldn't be run at the same time. Similarly rename the
	  config classes.

	* Added Ruby versions of the plasmoidviewer and engineexplorer tools. This
	  is a good test for the Plasma bindings and in particular the code in the
	  viewer is useful showing how to load an applet in a Qt::GraphicsView 
	  outside the Plasma process.
	* Fixed up some of the license text in the applet examples.

	* Some fixes for the digital clock example now KSharedConfig::Ptr
	  marshalling is working.
	* Added marshallers for QList<Plasma::Containment*>, QList<Plasma::PlotColor>,
	  QList<Plasma::SearchMatch*>, Plasma::Applet::List and 
	  Plasma::AbstractRunner::List

2008-04-07  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

	* Added analog-clock and webapplet examples
	* Added the digital-clock example

2008-04-07  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

	* Add a '-DRUBY_EMBEDDED' option so that QtRuby is built with code to call
	  RUBY_INIT_STACK before a non-nested virtual method call or slot invocation

2008-04-05  Richard Dale  <richard.j.dale@gmail.com>

	* Added some type() methods for Plasma classes so that they are called, rather
	  than the Ruby Object#type method.
	* Added a marshaller for the Plasma::PackageStructure::Ptr type
