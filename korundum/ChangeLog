	* A DCOPClient instance is now created for classes with a 'k_dcop_signals'
	  declaration, and emitDCOPSignal() is called on that.

	* Ruby DCOP support now working - here is some example code:

		require 'Korundum'
		class MyWidget < KDE::PushButton
			k_dcop 'QPoint mySlot(int,QString)'
	
			def initialize(parent, name)
				super
			end
			
			def mySlot(counter,greeting)
				return Qt::Point.new(50, 100)
			end
		end

	  - This slot is passed an integer and a string, and returns a Qt::Point.
	  - Note that the class doesn't have to inherit from DCOPObject. If you
	    include a 'k_dcop' slots declaration a 'listener' dcop object instance
	    is created automatically.

	* Imported krubyinit sources, thus at last fixing the startup segv's with gentoo/x86/qt 3.2.
