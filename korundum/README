KDE Specific Infomation:

	- DCOP Support. Here is a minimal ruby dcop slot implementation:
	
			require 'Korundum'
			class MyWidget < KDE::PushButton
				k_dcop 'QPoint mySlot(int,QString)'
	
				def initialize(parent, name)
					super
				end
			
				def mySlot(counter,greeting)
					return Qt::Point.new(50, 100)
				end
			end

		This slot is passed an integer and a string, and returns a Qt::Point.
		
		Note that the class doesn't have to inherit from DCOPObject. If you
		  include a 'k_dcop' slots declaration a 'listener' dcop object 
		  instance is created automatically.
